IT5 Elective Assignment 1

📌 Description
This is a menu-driven Python program that allows the user to input a sentence and perform different string operations on it.

Operations:
0. Enter a new sentence > lets the user replace the current sentence.
1. Reverse the sentence > flips the sentence backwards.
2. Count vowels > counts how many vowels are in the sentence.
3. Check if palindrome > checks if the sentence reads the same forward and backward.
4. Find and replace > finds a word in the sentence and replaces it with another.
5. Title case > converts the sentence into title case (first letter capitalized).
6. Split into words > breaks the sentence into a list of words.
7. Word frequency counter > counts how many times each word appears.
8. Swap case > changes uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.
9. Exit > quits the program.
